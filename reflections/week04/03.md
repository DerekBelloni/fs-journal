## Questions

1. What is the purpose of `Async`/`Await`?


        The purpose of async/await is to create functions where the code doesn't run immediately but rather certain portions of code wait upon other portions of code to preform their operation.
2. What must you do in order to  `await` a promise inside of a function?

        You must declare the function as async before the function identifier, then you must declare await directly in front of the portion of code that you wish to wait, whether it is getting data from an API or a window.confirm method.
3. What are some of the primary benefits of `Async`/`Await`?

        Some primary benefits of Async/Await are more readable code, chaining multiple async functions and making debugging easier

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

        Today's assignment was a lesson that devil is in the details. What I mean specifically is that things like consistent spelling, good naming conventions other small syntactical issues can stop your code in its tracks. It might be easier to fix than bad logic, but it is a wrench in the spokes none the less.
