> **ðŸ“– [Callback Hell](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk4/01-Callbacks)**

## Questions

1. What are some of the signs and causes of `Callback Hell`?

        Some of the signs and causes of callback hell is code that slants hard to the right because seemingly perpetual nesting of functions. It is often caused by trying to write code that executes top to bottom.

2. What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?

        Asynchronous essentially means not in happening at the same time. This involves callback functions because callback functions are not written in sequential order, and though at first glance it makes intuitive sense to write that way. A callback function will have functions declared below a function invocation in the code and the function declared is passed into the function invoked above it.

3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix `Callback Hell`

        Three ways to avoid callback hell is to keep code shallow,  modularize and handle every single error.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

    The takeaway from today's assignment was putting past struggles behind me and not letting negativity get to me. I came into the program today feeling pretty deflated, struggled all weekend on a bit of code that I wasn't able to complete by this morning. I chose to shake it off, take care of my afternoon assignment and was able to fix it before the day was done.
