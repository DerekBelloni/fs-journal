## Questions

1. What are the three states of a `Promise`?

      The three states of a 'Promise' are pending, resolved, rejected.

2. How do `promise`s seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?

      Promises seek to resolve the issue of callback hell by attaching callbacks through a process of chaining as opposed to passing them.

3. What is the difference between `.then()` and `.catch()`?

      The method .then() is used for deciding what to do once a promise is resolved, whereas the .catch() method is used for handling what to do next if a promise is rejected.
