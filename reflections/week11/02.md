## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`

    A primary key are unique pieces of information used to identify pieces of data in a table. A foreign key is a another tables primary key and used to create a relationship between the two tables.
2. What is an `Alias`?

An alias in this context is a shorthand in a query statement for a tables name, i.e. cars c.

3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)
 string sql = @"
 SELECT 
 dp.*,
 d.*,
 p.*
 FROM doctors dp (the many to many doctos)
 JOIN doctors d ON d.id = dp.doctorId
 JOIN patiens p ON p.id = dp.patientsId
 "
```

THe big takeaway today is how important it is to keep naming conventions as clear as possible with many to many's. Otherwise creating view models can be a little confusing as to what its referring too.
