## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.


      It is hard to believe this moment has come. I remember the first checkpoint and how amazed I feel simply manipulating the DOM using bootstrap. Then finishing inspire and feeling very confident, just to have that confidence smashed by being introduced to VUE. I remember the sense of accomplishment I had after finishing the gauntlet, I still feel good about that. Friday morning I was definitely concerned about the final, but as I write this it is Sunday evening and I am much further along then I hoped to be coming into the weekend. I think a big reason for that is I have been effectively time boxing, moving on to something else if I got stuck in one are. In this course I have enjoyed learning to program and getting to know everyone at Codeworks. Also, I have really gained a sense of pride of pushing myself to do something that is legitimately difficult and not giving up when the self doubt was overwhelming.
