## Questions

1. What does Inheritance accomplish for us in C#?

Inheritance allows for a relationship between a base class and a derived class. The derived class inherits an instance of the base class.

2. How does Member inheritance work in C#? Does a class inherit all members of the base class?

A class does not inherit all members of the base class. Constructors are an example of a member that a class does not inherit from its base class, everything else is inherited. Also inheritance is transitive, meaning that if B inherits from A and C inherits from B, then C has inherited from A.

3. How does accessibility affect inheritance?

Accessibility does not effect whether a member is inherited or not, only whether the inherited member is visual. Private members are not visible in derived classes unless the derived class is nested in the base class.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

There isn't any big takeaway from today, more so a reminder on the importance of getting repetition when practicing a new language. Also im finding it quite annoying to drop a table because I forgot one property.
