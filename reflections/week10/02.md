## Questions

1. What is a List in C#?

        A list in C# is a data structure for holding collections of data. It is similar to an array except where an array can only hold a collection of one data type, a list can hold a variety of data types.

2. What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?

        It seems likely I'll use the insert method often because it seems very applicable when needing to add new data to a list.

3. How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?

        I would retrieve an item from list using the List.Find method because it seems the most direct way to retrieve a piece of data that matches  a given predicate.

        The big takeawy today is that I might actually miss gregslist once I'm no longer at codeworks, that concept has helped drive home so many various aspects of what I have learned in programming so far.
