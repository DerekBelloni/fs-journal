## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

        The three categories of data types are value, reference and pointer. Value type holds data directly in its own memory space. Reference type data holds the address of the data in its own memory space, not the data itself. Pointers are similar to reference type but only apply to unmanaged data types.

2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

        The value type data types are: bool, byte, char, decimal, double, enum, float, int, long, sbyte, short, struct, uint, ulong, ushort. There appear to be about twice as many data types as in javascript, moreover a few of the data types in C# would be umbrellad into one type in javascript such decimal, double and int would all just be numbers in javascript.

3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?

        Reference types own memory space holds the address of where the data it refers to can be found. This differs from value types because the value of the value type exists in the vakue types own storage.
