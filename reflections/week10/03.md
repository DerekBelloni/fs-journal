## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?

        The difference between information in a column and information in a row is that information in a column is a specific property of an object whereas a row is an entire object.

2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS characters(
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT primary key,
  createdAt DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP COMMENT 'Time Created',
  updatedAt DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP COMMENT 'Last Update',
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  age TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT NOT NULL
) default charset utf8 COMMENT '';

3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;
```
Delete from table will delete a row from a table where as drop table will delete the entire table.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

My takeaway today is that I'm really enjoying utilizing both C# and sql. Using a strictly typed language like C# that stops you from proceeding at the moment one thing is wrong is really helping in making certain concepts stick at a more foundational level of understanding.
