## Questions

1. What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?

Enums are strongly typed constants represented by symbolic names and they represent integral values, i.e. numeric values.

2. How can you modify an Enum?

An enum can be modified by changing its base type, the baseline data type it represents. Through the method GetEnumFromUser(), a different integral value type can be cast to the enum.

3. How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)

I have yet to use enums while working with C# but I imagine I could in the AllSpic checkpoint when working with the steps of a recipe.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

The takeawa today is I'm really starting to find that I prefer backend work. I don't mean to disparage front end work, which is enjoyable in its own right but I simply like back end better and I can't put my finer on exactly why.
