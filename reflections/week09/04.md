## Questions

1. What is an SSL certificate?

        SSL certificates are small digital files that create an encrypted link between a web server and a browser. This will ensure that all data passed back and forth stays private.

2. What are the different types of certificates? What are they used for?

        The three different types of certificates are encryption, validation and domain number, each having three subcategories. Extended validation certificates are used to show legitmacy as a business, often used to for websites offering financial services or data collection. Organization Validated certificates are used for verifying the legitmacy of an organization and offer less encryption then extended validation. Domain Validation Cerificates offers the least amount of security while still validating the organizations domain as legitimate but nothing more.

3. What are some benefits of using SSL certificates?

        Some of the benefits of SSL certificates are providing a stamp of legitimacy for websites, legitimacy in claiming they are who they are and also an assurance that there will be some level of encryption protecting any data passed back and forth between the browser and the server.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's work


        I suppose today's takeaway is my growing sense of confidence in my capacity to learn a tech stack. Granted I still look at myself as a novice but relative to where I started I'm actually impressed with myself, and I'm never impressed by myself.
