## Questions

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?

      Some of the principles and technologies we are using in our capstone project are the Single Responsibility Principle and the Open Closed Principle from SOLID principles and we also utilized the single page application design paradigm.
2. What went well so far?

      So far a number of things have gone well. We have been good as a group about incorporating the ideas of all group members. We have also stayed ahead of our schedule, allowing us time to consider various stretch goals we weren't sure we would be able to get to.

3. What would you do differently? Why?

      What I would do differently next time is utlize more visualization in our early planning beyond figma, such as taking advantage of our whiteboard for quick planning of work flow or the look of a single component.
