## Questions

1. What is a Base64 Encoded Image?

        A Base64 encoded image is an image that uses an encoding schema to represent its data in a text format. This can be useful when the storage/delivery medium does not support binary data such as html/css.

2. What are the drawbacks of using Base64 Encoding?

        Some of the drawbacks to Base64 encoding are increased file size and extra work encoding and decoding. A Base64 image increase file size, on average, by 25%. Also, the process of decoding Base64 encoded strings and the images increases the workload asked of the cpu.

3. Why are these drawbacks issues in this day and age versus in the past?

        Base64 images seem to still be an issue because it go engrained into people as good practice back when it was good practice and the habit simply hasn't died.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's work

        I suppose the takeaway from today is that though the project stretch goals are fun and exciting, it is important to wrap up the functionality of the minimum viable product before moving on to them. We all got very excited about jumping into finger swipes and such but then realized we still had some minor base functionality to attend to before moving on.
