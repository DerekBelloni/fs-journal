## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

        The main ways to write information to the consolse would be to use console.log() directly from a code editor or in the console tab of the dev tools. It is preferrable to use your own code editor if you wish to make a change permanent and dev tools would be preferrable if you are quickly trying to test a change to code without needing it to persist through a page refresh.

2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

        The elements tab allows you see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and this can be useful when debugging HTML by being able to see bugs/code breakdowns right where they happen.

3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

        A better way to debug than writing everything to the console would be to use the dev tools debugger tool. This allows you to run code a single line at a time, further helping in isolating where exactly a problem is occurring in code.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

        The biggest takeaway I have from today's assignment is that it is really important to stay fresh on the foundational material that we have moved on from in course. I came back from lunch so anxious to tackle the javascript portion of the assignment that I initially rushed through setting up my HTML format for the assignment. I actually had relatively easy going with my javascript (moreso than I thought I would) but my HTML structure was a bit sloppy and it would have been much more efficient to slow down and flush out the HTML properly as opposed to having to go back an rework it at the end.
