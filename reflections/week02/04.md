## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?

        There are seveeral benefits to making a plan before starting to code. It develops a general framework by which to structure your code. Also it helps with defining the role of each function so you can maintain single responsibility as much as possible. It will ultimately make code more efficient and light weight.

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?

      When I am stuck I use a few resources to find answers. If I am at BCW I look to teachers and peers for guidance. Beyond that I use Google, reference previous lectures and past projects as well.

3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?

      The biggest takeaway from the article are the importance of planning, not overplanning and keeping code as efficient as possible. I chose these as my takeaways because they are the most salient in my limited coding experience thus far.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

        I have two main takeaways from todays assignment. The first takeaway is the importance of keeping my code simple and writing clearly understandable functions that serve one role. Everytime I had to get help from a teacher, it resulted in a cleaner code where every function served a single responsibility where previously there would be multiple things happening inside a single function and I could not pin point why it wasn't working as intended. The other takeaway is that I definitely need to plan my code before I dive in. Today I dove in immediately, would write a bit of code and then spend a good chunk of time debugging. When I would finally get one function to work, I would repeat the process again as opposed to stepping back and thinking about what I was going to do next.
