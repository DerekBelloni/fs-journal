## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

        The first way to write a function is a function declaration: 
          function name(parameters) {
            // code
          }.
        The second way is a function expression:
          let name = function(parameters) {
            // code
          }.
        The third way is a function expression written in a shorthand:
          let name = (parameters) => {
            // code
          }
          The main difference is the a function declaration is hoisted and can be used before it's defined. Function expressions on the other hand are anonymous and are not hoisted.
2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

        The difference between a parameter and an argument are that parameters define what kind of values can be input into a function during declaration. Arguments are the values that are passed into a function when the function is being invoked.

3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?

         higher order function is a function that takes a function as a parameter or returns a function. An example would be Array.prototype.find.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

A key takeaway from today's assignment is the importance of understanding, very clearly, what every line of code you write is supposed to do. The impulse to reference similar code isn't necessarily bad if it is used as a jumping off point but can't be used as a substitute for comprehension.
