# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

        
        What went well this week was the checkpoint, or at the very least the progress I made with it during Friday lab. Everything I had been struggling with in the first week of Javascript essentially boiled down to writing cluttered functions that were attempting to do to much. I was surprised how much the Thursday night fireside really helped a lot of the concepts we had been working on all week really click. I count the entire week as a victory.
