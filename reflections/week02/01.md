## Questions

1. What is Scope ?

        Scope is the context in which variables are declared. There seem to be three different contexts which define the state of scope: global, function and block. A variable declared globally can be accessed from anywhere inside a program. A variable declared inside a function can be accessed only inside that function. A variable declared within block scope (inside of curly brackets) can only be accessed within those same curly brackets.

2. What is Hoisting ?

         Hoisting is a default behavior within Javascript that brings variable, function or class declarations to the top of their scope before code is executed.

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

        Var is good to use when needing to access a variable globally and can be used inside functions as well but because its ability to be redeclared, redundant naming conventions can lead to bugs in code if a var variable is overdeclared. Let is good to use when it is only needed in local/block scope and when there might be a need to update it. Const is good to use when a variable is needed in local/block scope and then there is no need to update it later.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

        The biggest takeaway from today's assignment is how beneficial it can be to keep one's code as concise and efficient as possible. The more cluttered code becomes in Javascript, it becomes quite easy to lose track of the logic needed to execute rather simple functions.
