## Questions

1. In simple terms what is timeboxing?

        Timeboxing put simply is giving yourself a predetermined amount of time in which to complete a task.

2. What three strategies will you implement and how?

        I will implement the following strategies: strateigc quitting, practice and adapt and being flexible. I will use strategic quitting when I am stuck on a task that I scheduled myself to be over with by moving on to a different task and timeboxing what is unfinished later. I will adapt and practice with peristent effort. Finally I will be flexible by tinkering with my timebox strategies based on what I find most effective.

3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how? 

        I benefited from timeboxing during this last check point. I went to the coffeeshop last saturday for three hours and I allotted myself an hour for three different tasks. The final task wasn't complete after my time was up and instead of staying at it, I went home and took a break. When I came back to that task I was able to finish it rather easily.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

My takeaway from today's assignment is the need to understand data relationships before you start coding them. I took my time and mapped out my data relationships on lucid charts and it really helped me remember their heirarchy.
