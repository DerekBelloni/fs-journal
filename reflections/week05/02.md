## Questions

1. What are the three types of relationships?

      The three types of relationships are one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many.
2. What are the benefits of the traditional `linking` of relationships instead of `Embedding`

        The benefits of linking as opposed to embedding is that if there is a need to embedd a large list of data objects then maz size of the file that data is being embedded to can be exceeded rather easily.

3. What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?

        When deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship, first establish a number for how many data points are in each side of the relationship. If there is a discrepancy of several orders of magnitude (tens of thousands of books per one genre for example), then one way embedding would be preferrable. If both sides of the relationship are relatively low numbers, two embedding might be preferred.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

        A takeaway from todays assignment is being meticulous with syntax when establishing a server and spinning it up before moving on to code. Having to restart a project because domains/clients/audiences isn't set up properly is not ideal.
