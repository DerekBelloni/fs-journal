Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

        My big takeaway from today is that I'm starting to understand vue pages and components better, and that SPA architecture is a pretty big departure from MVC. I keep finding that the way I intuitively think of bringing in data to a page is different then how vue does it, need to remind myself that vue pages are self contained.
