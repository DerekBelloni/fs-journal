## Questions

1. What is a nested route?
 
      A nested route is a route component nested inside of another route component. This allows for more indepth UI's that allow the user to hop from one spot of a website to multiple others and vice versa.

2. When might you use a nested route? (other than the provided example)

      An example of a nested route would be using a website with personal profiles. Inside someone's landing page for their profile their might be a route to a page that is more specific and still personal to them, a page with all their pics perhaps.

3. Can you pass parameters through nested routes? When might you use them?

      You can pass parameters through nested routes and this could be useful when using a route that is specific to an individual and needs an id parameter so you are routed to a new page with that individuals specific info.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

        The big takeawr from today's assignment is to try to keep a clear mental route of how your pages and components interact with one another, i.e. what are the paths data takes to get from one place to another. If you don't do this it becomes easy to be lost quickly.
