2. What are some benefits of Component based architecture?

        CBA seems to benefit from its modular design by allowing developers to upgrade individual components without effecting other components. This could speed up coding changes and limit bugs in one component having downstream effects in other components.
3. What are some drawbacks to Component based architecture?

      Some of the drawbacks of CBA design are that readability can be convoluted because every component is self contained and needs all the code necessary to be so. Also over engineering can be a problem as well, programmers often treat every single part of the UI as a component.
