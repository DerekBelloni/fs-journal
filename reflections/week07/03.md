## Questions

1. What is a User Experience? What should be considered when developing a User Experience?

        The user experience is the experience of the end user of any piece of programming, a website or a computer/phone application. A big consideration is does your product help the user do what they want to do when using it.

2. What are some benefits of taking into account the User Experience?

        The benefits of taking into account the user experience are creating a site/application that encourages the user to reuse the site/application in the future and the further the success of your business, Im assuming that is the end goal of most websites/applications.

3. Why is the User Experience important?

        The user experience is important because it is not only the  public facing side of your business/service but most likely the first impression. If someone has a bad user experience, it is doubtful it will increase confidence in the quality of the service/product being offered at the other end of the experience.
