# Sprint Retrospective

![replace_me](https://codeworks.blob.core.windows.net/public/assets/img/illustrations/placeholder.svg)

## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

        The principles implemented from this week were really focused around pair programming. My partner and I very consistently switched between driver and navigator. We would catch mistakes the other made and notice when the other was getting fried and initiate a break or change roles.
2. What went well this week?

        What went well this week was perservering through difficult spots, time boxing when we had to. It's helpful to keep momentum rolling instead stubbornly attacking a problem that is more easily solved by leaving it alone for a little while.
3. What would you do differently?

        I would take the time, I mean and hour or two, to write out a flushed out roadmap of how to approach project. The more I roadmap and pseudocod, the less troubles I seem to have.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

        The takeaway is how pronounced the pros and cons of working with someone else are. It was lesson, for both of us Im sure, about having patience and understanding with someone else but also gratitude for the help they provide.
