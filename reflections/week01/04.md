## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 

        There are several purposes for wire framing. Wireframing allows for communication in early stage web design and testing as well. A developer can get a nuanced understanding of the users experience of the product, identify and solve potential problems before those problems ever manifest. Developers can also get a visual sense of an idea rather quickly compared to building a fully flushed out website.

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

        The different levels of detail in wireframes are low-fidelity, mid-fidelity and high-fidelity. Low-fidelity wireframes are the basic concepts being visualized while ommitting any styling, photos, icons, etc. Low-fidelity seems very useful for seeing how well ideas might work before choosing a specific direction to go in. Mid-fidelity wire frames are not fully stylized but have diffentiated the more specific concepts that will be applied to the site. High-fidelity wireframes are much closer to a finished product than an early stage product. They may include pics, actual written content and functionality.
3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

        I believe that wire-frames are worth the time and effort. It seems a lot of time and heartbreak can be saved with wireframes as opposed to creating a fully finished website just to have an employer/client to say they don't like it and having to start over from scratch.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

        The major takeaway from todays assignment is what it means to design with another person as opposed to alone. It is very important to be able to communicate what you are currently doing, what you think should be done next, what the other person thinks, how to divide the work and sharing the code.
