## Questions

1. In your own words, why do we use Git?

        The reason developers use git is multifaceted. Git allows developers to modify and track additions to code, whether as individuals working alone or as a team of developers working in parallel. Moreover, it provides a means to revert to older versions of the code if necessary.
2. What are the benefits of having multiple branches?

        The benefits of having multiple branches is that it allows experimental and test branches of code to be developed in parallel to the main branch. Git also provides a mechanism to merge the various other branches to the main branch if desired.
3. What is the difference between Git and GitHub
        
        The difference between Git and Github is that Git is a local repository for storing code on a developers computer and Github is a remote repository that allows various developers to access, track and modify the code.
