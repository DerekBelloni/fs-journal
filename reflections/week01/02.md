## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use

      A Psuedo-Class is used define unique states of an element. Some of the Pseudo-Selectors I think I will use most commonly are :hover for changing the color of a button as mouse hovers over it, and :link for changing a links color if it's been visited.

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

      Specificity is a numerical measure applied to different css selectors. When different selectors are targeting the same property on the same element, the selector with the higher specificity is given priority and applied to the element property.

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

      Over utilization of the !important feature could be problematic because any element with !important applied will not be able to utilize other css selectors, limiting the overall options with regards to styling.
