## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

        My favorite tip that I believe will be most beneficial to my design is using a soft touch for a more intuitive aesthetic design. One specific example is using fewer borders. On top of that, I like the idea of using a colorful accent border on one side of an object to liven it up. I also really like the idea of using offset shadows to give a shadow the appearance of coming from a natural light source.

2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

        There are a couple of  resources that I believe would be helpful when reviewing examples of good design ideas. Websites such as stackoverflow and reddit seem to be good places to spitball ideas directly off of developers and to see what ideas other developers themselves have. Also, browsing various popular websites and searching for continuity amongst different design ideas seems like it could be promising. Also a simple google search is never to be underestimated.

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

        I believe good design is extremely important for influencing people when visiting a website. In the culinary industry there is an expression, "people eat with there eyes." What is meant by this is that no matter how good a meal might taste there will be a significant number of people who won't even consider eating it if it's not visually appealing. I would assert that this analogizes perfectly with any type of visual design, especially web development. Through design alone, a website can convey the level competence about whatever the website is selling writ large (be it a product, political candidate, etc.). It also conveys thoughtfulness and thoroughness. People are less inclined to engage with a websites content if the page itself appears to the product of minimal effort or talent.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

  Today's assignment really drove home the reality of how expansive web design is and how far there is to go in my journey of learning software development. Before I started this program I would have likened it to standing at the base of Everest getting ready to start the climb and now its as if I have to walk to the Pacific coast, row a boat to Asia, walk to the Himalayas and then I'm at the base of Everest. Very daunting but still fun and exciting.
