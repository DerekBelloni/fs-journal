# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

        This week has been quite the experience, a radical departure from my adult life as I have known it. I can honestly say there weren't any shocks or surprises because I came into the program not knowing what to expect. My biggest struggle isn't necessarily any specific piece of content but a high level of mental fatigue by the end of the day, though I find myself acclimating pretty quickly. As a person who has worked as a cook his entire life I realize I had fallen into the habit of going into auto-pilot a lot of the time. I count the entire experience thus far as a victory but more specifically the progress I made this afternoon on the first checkpoint felt extremely good.
