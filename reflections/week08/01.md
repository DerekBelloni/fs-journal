## Questions

1. What function does a developer Portfolio provide?

        A developer portfolio is multi-functional. Most importantly, it directly demonstrates your ability to write executable code. It is also a good way to make yourself unique while interviewing and develops your brand as a software developer.

2. What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?

        An effective developer portfolio is one that demonstrates a few things. A portfolio project can be a website used by an actual local business, showing competency in a real market product. Also cloning portions of a huge name companies site can demonstrate the potential to design at a market leading level.

3. What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?

        The first project of mine I would include is my tower checkpoint. It still needs some tweeking in terms of a couple of functions but I would include this because it is my best looking project to date. Bootstrap seemed to click pretty well designing the tower checkpoint. I would also include the inspire checkpoint and a vue weather app I did as code along from a youtube tutorial on vue.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's work

My big takeaway from today is how amazing it felt to reach the passing on the tower checkpoint. Also I'm very grateful to Brian for being so understanding in me using the turn around time to finish my checkpoint while he ventured forth, solo, on starting the capstone project.
