## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

        The three types of testing in Vue are unit, component and end-to-end testing. Unit allows testing of isolated units of code, component testing allows for testing of whole components and end-to-end is full coverage testing of the entire program.

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

        If I had to choose one method of testing for Vue I would choose end-to-end. The reason for this is that if the ultimate goal is a fully functional program, end-to-end will test for that. There is obviously utility in more compartmentalized testing, but end-to-end will capture that and more. 
3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

        I think unit testing seems like the least useful testing in my opinion. I say this because it seems plausible to have many passing unit tests while still having non functional components, let alone entire programs.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's work

        My takeaway today is to be more realistic with sprint times in planning. We didn't overshoot our initially timed plans by too much, but we had unforeseen hiccups that should be accounted for to some degree.
