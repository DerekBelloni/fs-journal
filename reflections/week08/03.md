## Questions

2. What are the benefits of Testing in software development?

        The benefits of testing in softare development are elimination of worry and confidence. Unit testing also encourages one to think about all potential edge cases that might cause code to fail and to design with that in mind.

3. What are some potential drawbacks of Testing in software development?

        Some drawbacks of testing in software development are that programmers are not typically in the habit of testing code in isolation, and since it is simple enough to compile all the code in a few seconds it weakens the incentive to do so. Also, it might be difficult to convince others that the cost of testing the code in units is worth it when there already exists qa teams testing the code.
