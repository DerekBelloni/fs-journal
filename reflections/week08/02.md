## Questions

1. Why is communication on a small team important?

        Communication on a small team is important because it allows for a more efficient work flow on a project. It does this specifically by reducing the number of meetings held to discuss progress while still keeping key client members equally up to speed on the progress.

2. What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?

        The adjustments necessary to adapt a small scrum team to agile methodology are how slack is utilized. Slack is an effective work team communication app and can be utilized to maximize communication while reducing meetings and can also be used to include client members on real time updates.

3. What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?

        The unattainable triangle is based on three princeples: good service cheap won't be fast, good service fast won't be cheap and fast service cheap won't be good. It establishes a tradeoff relation ship between good quality, fast product development and cheap cost of development and it postulates that no matter how you slice it, only 2/3 are possible.
