## Questions

1. What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?

        The problems the Observer Pattern seeks to solve are ones where an event needs to be observed and once observed, that observation needs to be broadcasted out.

2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?

        The three mechanisms of the observer pattern are arrange, act and assert.

3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.

        From what I can ascertain, the file in the utilities folder labeled event emitter has several functions that allow for the listening of events in order to manipulate arrays that exist in the app state.
