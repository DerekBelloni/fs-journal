## Questions

1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?

        The purpose of encapsulation is to store an objects state privately, limiting access to it by only allowing that objects methods to access it. This also allows for data sets to be implamented in different data structure types later on.

2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?

        The problems with closures, from what I could glean from the article, is that early Javascript developers were unaware of using closures as a mechanism for data privacy. So instead they used the underscore prefix method which was intended for methods that users of API's can't directly access. This can allow users to create data dependencies on the underlying data structures which could break code later on if changes are implemented. Also, this creates potential exploits for hackers.

3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?

        To create a private variable in an ES6 class, one would declare the variable in construction/factory scope. There seem to be many reasons one would do this, limited by the various reasons anyone might want information kept private. The information could be financially private or classified.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

  The biggest takeaway from today's assignment is the utility of using console.log very frequently with coding. When using a console.log after writing small bits of code, it helped me clarify what I was attempting to do with my code, which could have been very confusing otherwise as I jumped between different js files.
