Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

        The key takeaway from today's assignment is that learning comes with building my own code when a fully flushed out analog is right there for the taking. I could have simply copied the greg's list car sections code but I only used it as a reference. Doing that made me focus on what every bit of code I was producing was actually doing, applying console.logs to be sure before moving on to the next section.
