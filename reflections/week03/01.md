        Exporting solves the problem of having to route multiple javascript files through scripts inside of html, making a program more efficient.

        Export differs from from export default in that export default only allows the exportation of a single class, function or primitive from a script file, where as export allows the exportation of multiple script files.

        The benefit of using the module system is that code can be split into smaller files, debugging is simpler and modules can be concatenated for increased performance.
